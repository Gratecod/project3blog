        <h2 id="khan-experience">The Khan Academy Coding Experience</h2>
        
        <p id="flashy">I have been on this coding journey with Khan Academy since <strong>March 15, 2022.</strong>  Since then I believe that I have made very good progress with my coding efforts.  One of the things that I enjoy about the course is that the instructor takes a no nonsense approach that gets you up and running immediately.   </p>

        <p>Her instructions are clear, simple, and easy to follow, and one of the big plus to doing this course are the hands on projects found at the end of each "module segments." They test your ability by building up on what you have learned, and help to bring out the creativity in you. Kudos to Khan Academy and instructor Pamela!</p>
        
        <p id="great">One of the most exciting things I've learned is how to make internal links on pages that have very long content.  This is something that I have always wanted to do and often wondered how it works.  Not anymore, because this course has made it <em>so easy</em> to do!</p>
        
        
    <h2 id="timeframe">Time Frame To Complete HTML&CSS Course</h2> 
    
       
        <p>I am so excited about this course that I have worked out a time frame to complete the course, and move on to do a course in Javascript. My aim is to become a <em class="front-end">Front End Developer,</em> then move on to become a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>.  Listed below is a table of when I expect to complete this course and the amount of modules I will need to complete per week.</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                <th>Today's date</th>
                
                  <th>Expected Completion Date</th>
                  <th>Number of modules</th>
                    <th>Avail Weeks</th>
                    <th>Modules per week</th>
                </tr>
                
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                     <td>3-28-22</td>
                     <td>6-30-22</td>
                        <td>35</td>
                        <td>14</td>
                        <td>3</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </thead>
        </table>
       
                <p>Gleaning from the simple table above, I would need to complete 3 modules/videos per week to complete the course by June 30, 2022. However, I plan on doing 10 modules per week which would allow me to complete the course within a 4 weeks period by the latest April 30th. </p> <p>I would then spend the next two months learning Javascript and getting familiar with a text editor like VS Code or Atom, and sharpen my coding skills by doing a lot of practice.  So when all is said and done, my hope is to land a job as a <strong>Front End Developer</strong> by July-August of 2022.  Let's get ready to code!</p>
